        <h1>Google Map Field Widget for Odoo</h1>

        <div class="description">
            <p>
                This Google Map field widget is designed for use in your Odoo application. It allows
                users to enter addresses efficiently by integrating Google Maps, providing address
                suggestions as they type. The selected address is then stored in the field for later
                use, and users can interact with the map to visually update the address.
            </p>
            <p>
                The widget is linked to a <span class="highlight">char field</span> with the widget
                property set to <span class="highlight">google_map_field</span>.
            </p>

        </div>

        <div class="steps">
            <h2>How the Google Map Field Works:</h2>
            <ol>
                <li>
                    <strong>Activate Google Maps API:</strong> Before using the widget, you must
                    activate your Google Maps API key once. The key is necessary to enable the
                    address search and map functionalities. If you don't have an API key, you can
                    easily obtain one from the
                    <a href="https://developers.google.com/maps/gmp-get-started" target="_blank"
                        >Google Maps Platform</a
                    >.
                </li>

                <li>
                    <strong>Start Typing an Address:</strong> As soon as the user starts typing an
                    address in the field, the widget communicates with Google Maps to suggest
                    possible address matches in real-time. This provides an easy way to find the
                    correct address without having to manually enter the full details.
                    <img src="banner.png" class="oe_picture oe_screenshot" />

                </li>

                <li>
                    <strong>Select an Address:</strong> After typing, the user can choose from the
                    list of suggested addresses. Once an address is selected, it is automatically
                    saved to the field. The selected address is stored in its proper format, ready
                    for use throughout the application.
                </li>

                <li>
                    <strong>Open the Map View:</strong> To ensure the address is correct, the user
                    can click the pin icon. This opens a map view of the selected address, which
                    provides a visual representation of the location.
                    <img src="map_pick.png" class="oe_picture oe_screenshot" />
                </li>

                <li>
                    <strong>Update the Address on the Map:</strong> If the user wants to make
                    adjustments to the selected address, they can drag the pin on the map to a new
                    location. The address will automatically update to reflect the new position,
                    ensuring that the stored address is always accurate.
                </li>
            </ol>

        <div class="note">
            <p>
                <strong>Note:</strong> The widget only requires the Google Maps API key to be
                activated once. If the API key is missing or incorrect, the widget will not function
                properly, so make sure to enter a valid API key.
